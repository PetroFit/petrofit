    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the advent of quantitative photometric studies of galaxies, measuring their true sizes and fluxes has proven to be a challenging task. This is because the true extent of a galaxy can be hard to define: it can vary with morphology, be difficult to distinguish from its neighbors, or difficult to measure due to low surface brightness features. Over time, researchers have proposed various approaches for estimating the fluxes, shapes, and angular (or projected) sizes of galaxies. A powerful technique for measuring accurate properties of galaxies is to combine parametric measurements with an analysis of the profile of the light distribution of a galaxy.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Parametric descriptions of galaxies were first introduced by  de Vaucouleurs (1948), who proposed a power-law profile that reasonably models the projected intensity profiles of galaxies. He used an $exp \\{-k r^{1/4}\\}$ intensity profile to describe the radial light distribution of elliptical galaxies. Following this model's success, Sérsic (1963, 1968) introduced a generalized version that can be applied to galaxies of various morphologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though the sizes of galaxies can be measured by fitting a Sérsic model to an image, various radii of interest can also be derived from radial photometric measurements.  Petrosian (1976) formulated a radial profile, now named after him, as a means of defining the projected radii of galaxies. Since the Petrosian profile is a ratio of surface brightnesses, it offers a distance-independent method of measuring galaxy radii. Petrosian radii are useful for computing radial concentrations of galaxy light profiles and for performing accurate measurements of  galaxy photometry. Petrosian radii and concentrations can also be used to estimate the parameters of Sérsic profiles. \n",
    "\n",
    "By combining parametric fitting and radial profile analysis, accurate fluxes, shapes, and sizes can be derived for studying the properties and evolution of galaxies. PetroFit, a Python package based on the Astropy and Photutils packages, was motivated by the need for an open-source package to compute Petrosian radii and magnitudes. The prime motivation for constructing this package was to make a robust and scalable software package for modeling Sérsic and Petrosian profiles. PetroFit is designed to work within the Astropy ecosystem with a focus on measuring accurate galaxy properties.  Following Crawford (2006), PetroFit uses correction grids to improve the size estimates produced by Petrosian profiles. PetroFit also provides a robust Python-based parameter fitter code based on Astropy models for parameterization of galaxy properties. In this section, we will be defining morphological properties that can be measured using the PetroFit package."

In other words, each pixel corresponds to a total surface brightness integrated within the area of the pixel as opposed to the surface brightness at the pixel coordinates. As such, PetroFit sets the first Petrosian value to \\texttt{numpy.nan} when returning a discretely computed array of Petrosian indices.

It is also not practical to consider minute flux values at very large radii because real images of galaxies contain noise. For these reasons `petrofit` considers the radius that contains 99% of the galaxy’s light to be the total flux radius. To attain this radius, we must multiply the Petrosian radius with a constant.

    "\n",
    "To first order, the Petrosian magnitude is independent of redshift as it depends on the ratio of two surface brightnesses, but because it is based on profile shape, changes in the profile due to morphological K-corrections still apply. However, the real strength of Petrosian magnitudes vs. other variable aperture photometry such as Kron magnitudes (Kron 1980) is that the Petrosian radius only depends on light interior to this radius. This aspect leads to small random errors in the measurement of $r_{petro}$. Nonetheless, the magnitude within $2 \\cdot r_{petro}$, relative to a true, total magnitude, is still profile dependent. Although 99% of the light from an exponential profile ($n=1$) is recovered within $2 \\cdot r_{petro}$, only 83.4% of the light for an $r^{1/4}$ profile is measured within $2 \\cdot r_{petro}$ (Graham et al. 2005).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of this, we need to adjust $r_{total}$ by finding the appropriate epsilon ($\\epsilon$) value. Both the consternation index and \"correct\" $r_{total}$ are related, thus a relationship between the consternation index and $\\epsilon$ can be derived by simulating Sérsic profiles. For ideal images of Sérsic models (no noise and no PSF), we can make a plot of $C2080$ vs Epsilon of simulated profiles with different half-light radii:\n",

The smearing of light results in the reduction of concentration, causing a skew in the relationship we derived above.
