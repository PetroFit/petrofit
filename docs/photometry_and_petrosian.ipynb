To compute the half light radius, we find the total flux (flux at `r_total_flux`) and divide it by half to find the “half flux” or “half light”. We then find the pixel closest to the half light value and define it as the half light radius. Please note that interpolation is used between the inputted flux radii to find the radius that best matches the half light flux.   \n",

    "We can use the `r_half_light_arcsec` function, by passing it a WCS object, to compute the half light radius in arcsec.\n"
