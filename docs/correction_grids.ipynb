    "## Necessity and Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "**Are Correction Grids Always Needed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The short answer is no, but they are very useful in some cases. \n",
    "Petrosian corrections offer more precise measurements of galaxies. \n",
    "The necessity hinges on your data quality, research goals, and desired precision. \n",
    "Here are key considerations on why the defualt settings are usually good enough:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Standard Practices**: Numerous studies, such as those from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), \n",
    "   rely on default settings. The parameters $\\eta = 0.2$ and $\\epsilon = 2$ are widely accepted because\n",
    "   they typically produce reliable results across many scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Noise Constraints**: If the fainter parts of galaxies in your images are submerged below the noise level, \n",
    "   detailed corrections might not significantly impact the outcome since that portion of the galaxy is not meaningfully\n",
    "   measurable. Here, the additional steps and computational demands of correction grids might be unwarranted.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Practical Implications**: While correction grids can produce improved results, \n",
    "   they require optimal background subtraction. Not all datasets might meet this standard.\n",
    " \n",
    "Correction grids promise enhanced precision but aren't always essential. \n",
    "For a majority of cases, default settings suffice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When are Correction Grids Needed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the default settings serve most general purposes, there are specific scenarios where \n",
    "correction grids are beneficial:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Galaxy Size Estimation**: If your research aims to measure the size of a galaxy which suffers due to \n",
    "   poor signal-to-noise, you can estimate its total flux radius based on the corrected epsilon. Remember, \n",
    "   this isn't about recovering the total flux which includes regions submerged under noise, but \n",
    "   about the estimating the full extent of the galaxy based on the measurable components of the light profile. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Estimating Sérsic Index**: Correction grids can be used to estimate the Sérsic index of single component galaxies.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **High-Precision Studies**: For projects that require a granular study of galaxy structures, \n",
    "   or when analyzing galaxies with distinct features that might get overlooked with standard parameters, \n",
    "   correction grids provide the extra precision that may be needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Superior Data Quality**: If you have high-quality images with excellent background subtraction \n",
    "   and reasonable signal-to-noise ratios, the total flux can be estimated to higher accuracy. That is,\n",
    "   high quality data allows you to measure the flux up to the corrected total flux radius. \n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, when the goal shifts from general measurements to intricate, high-resolution studies of galactic structures and sizes, correction grids become a useful tool.\n",
