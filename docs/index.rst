PetroFit is a Python package designed for calculating Petrosian properties, such as radii and concentration indices,
as well as fitting galaxy light profiles. In particular, PetroFit includes tools for performing accurate photometry,
segmentations, Petrosian profiling, and Sérsic fitting. This documentation is intended to serve as a description and
guide to the `petrofit` Python module. See the  `Table of Contents <Table of Contents_>`_ below or use the sidebar to
