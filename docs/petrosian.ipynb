    "## Corrections and Approximations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into corrections and approximations of Petrosian profiles, \n",
    "it's important to understand the broader context in which they're utilized. \n",
    "A significant portion of astronomical literature, including foundational analyses from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), \n",
    "predominantly relies on standard parameters: $\\eta=0.2$ and $\\epsilon=2$ for deriving the total flux. \n",
    "The rationale behind this prevalent practice is two-fold:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Noise Considerations**: In real-world observations, the faint extremities of galaxies often lie beneath the instrument's noise threshold. \n",
    "   This can render intricate corrections superfluous since the adjustments might not significantly alter the results.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Practicality Over Precision**: While the discussed corrections provide higher precision, \n",
    "   their application demands optimal background subtraction. Hence, they're often reserved for \n",
    "   scenarios that have ideal subtraction for flux measurements or for measuring galaxy's size at higher precision \n",
    "   given low signal-to-noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the default settings have historically been good enough. \n",
    "Given this backdrop, the forthcoming sub-section goes into specific techniques \n",
    "for those seeking to venture beyond the default parameters, either out of \n",
    "necessity or research specificity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "For accurately determining the total flux, the epsilon value should ideally be a function of the Sersic index. As the Sérsic index is correlated with the concentration index, we can leverage the measured concentration index to derive the appropriate value of epsilon, which, in turn, helps pinpoint the radii for total flux measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "To estimate epsilon, a few methods are at our disposal:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Utilizing Approximations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using the uncorrected concentration index (`U2080`), we can approximate both the Sérsic index and the corrected epsilon. This method relies on approximations derived from fitting these relationships against a standard Sérsic profile.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Pros**:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - A swift and straightforward means to approximate the Sérsic index and the corrected epsilon.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Only requires a moderate level of background subtraction.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  **Cons**:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Does not account for PSF, which notably affects high Sérsic index profiles with a small $r_{50}$.\n",
